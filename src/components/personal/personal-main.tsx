            Hi, My name is Duc, I'm a Software Engineering student at
            Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.
            <br />
            I have a strong passion for software development and digital
            services design.
            <br />
            I have experience in developing web applications using React,
            Node.js, Golang.
            <br />
            I have also worked on a few projects that involve designing digital
            services.
            <br />
            I have a good understanding of the principles of user experience
            design and I'm familiar with tools like Figma.
            <br />
            I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills in
            digital services design.

            this is a good design or not:

      A4: The Immutable Rules of UX by Jakob Nielsen

          This video includes keynotes by Jakob Nielsen is a great video talking
          about immutable rules remain constant in the field of UX.
        </li>
        <div>Highlights</div>
        <li>
          Nielsen outlines three design principles that have lived by time, such
          as early focus on users, empirical measurement, and iterative design.{" "}
          <br />
          These principles are the foundation but people often overlooked those
          in practice. <br />
          There is also a gap between knowledge and application in UX design.
          The speaker suggested that education must adherence to these
          principles to achieve more successful outcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nielsen demonstrates how understanding user context became incredibly
          important. Successful UX design must consider diverse user backgrounds
          and languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Usability Testing with real users is also very important as many
          design failures because of a lack of user testing. What we should do
          is to integrating user feedback into every stage of the design
          process, so that we can create more user friendly product.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nielsen mentioned that as websites improve, usersâ€™ expectations rise ,
          creating a continuous cycle of pressure to meet those expectation. The
          designers need to focus not just on improving products, but also on
          managing user expectations effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nielsen showed two critical gaps in user experience:the first one gap
          is the utility gap which questions about how the product meets the
          user need. And the second gap is the usability gap which question
          about how users can effectively use the product. This showed that even
          a well-designed features may fail if users can not easily access or
          use them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to both utility and usability issues, a big percentage of user
          needs are unmet. To solve this, designing an AI system is crucial
          because it make everything easier for users to engage with, thereby
          enhancing overall experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nielsen also said that UX is a long term work to do and it require
          continuous refinement and adaptation.
        </li>
        <li>
          As user needs and technologies evolve everyday, designers must stay
          updated all the time, continuously improving and ensuring that the
          products meet users expectations.
